Thisscript performs data analysis and visualization on a dataset related to gene expression. Here's an overview of its main components and functionality:

Library Imports: The script imports libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and several from scikit-learn (PCA, DBSCAN, OneHotEncoder) for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Data Loading: It loads a specific set of columns ('geneID', 'cell', 'x', 'y', 'MIDCounts') from a TSV (Tab Separated Values) file located at a specified path.
